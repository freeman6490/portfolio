        <p>My name is Luke Freeman, I am looking for entry level software development positions. My main strengths are scripting Languages,
            specifically Python. Along with that I have experience using C++, Java, and C#. I have designed a few full stack
            applications and have utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and QT/PyQT in order to do that.</p>
